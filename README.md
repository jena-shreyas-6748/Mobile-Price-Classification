# Mobile-Price-Classification

This is a project based on classifying mobile prices using ML and DL techniques.

The dataset used is available on Kaggle, you can check it out here : https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification

The dataset was first analyzed by doing extensive EDA and then various hyperparameterized ML and DL models were used to predict a price range, given the mobile phone's features.

I have uploaded the code file and project report for the same. The report contains a detailed explanation for the rationale behind the code.

Special thanks to Nitish Bhardwaj Putrevu and Bharath TVNS who helped make this possible!

Hope you like it :)
